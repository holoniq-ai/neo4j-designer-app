# Meta Model

## Idea

Idea is that you describe all your data with a model or a schema. 

Providing designer with a model of your data, helps him predefined

View contains witch data are you looking at, how it is presented (styling) and witch actions are available for this view.

>View defines:
>- data that is presented
>- styling of the data
>- position of the nodes
>- available actions

You create new view my modeling data in a graph for this we could first look at view model.
