# Views

## Idea 

Idea is that you could create your own views inside designer with a graph. 

View contains witch data are you looking at, how it is presented (styling) and witch actions are available for this view. 

>View defines:
>- data that is presented
>- styling of the data
>- position of the nodes
>- available actions

You create new view my modeling data in a graph for this we could first look at view model. 

## Model
